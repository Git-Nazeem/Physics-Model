    "This experiment will find out the amount of force needed to pull different weights. It will help find out some information about Friction and its applications on an object. Friction is the resistance or force an object will have sliding alongside another object or a surface. Static Friction is the force that matches and goes against an applied force on a stationary object. It is the amount of friction on a stationary object."

The model is linear and the amount of Force increases as the weight increases as the data shows. However as the angle of incline increases, the Static Friction decreases. Another way of saying that is the  Normal Force decreases as the angle of incline increases, along with the Static Friction decreasing."
